# Assignments
Key learning of this assignment is to understand the mathematical and logical properties of how a loss function works in Neural Network, what happens in the background when Pytorch calls functions like loss.backward(), how autograd works and so on. The fun part of solving this assignment is to play around with the animation properties of Python's plotting related libraries.

# CNN-Udacity
Created a Convolutional Neural Network to analyze CIFAR10 dataset. This code was reviewed from Udacity.

# CNN-from-Scratch
Created another Convolutional Network from scratch to analyze DogsVsCats dataset.

# FC-Neural-Network
Created a Fully connected Neural Network to analyze MNIST dataset from scratch.

# HPA-Project
This project is defined to understand image segmentation. The goal is to segment and classify each cells from microscopic images. This is an ongoing project in Kaggle. 

# Model-Intrepretability-Using-Captum
Used Captum library to apply gradient based algorithms like DeepLift and Integrated Gradient to understand Model Interpretability or Explainable AI.
