# Assignments
Key learning of this assignment is to understand the mathematical and logical properties of how a loss function works in Neural Network, what happens in the background when Pytorch calls functions like loss.backward(), how autograd works and so on. The fun part of solving this assignment is to play around with the animation properties of Python's plotting related libraries.
