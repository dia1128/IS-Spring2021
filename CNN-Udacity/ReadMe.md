## About 
I prepared this notebook for the purpose of a presentation on the architectural detials of Convolutional Neural Netowork (CNN). Here, a CNN was trained to classify images from the CIFAR-10 database. After testing the model it gives around 76% test accuracy. 

### My Understanding:
The model seems to work better on identifying vehicles rather than animals like cat. Adding more images of animals could be one solution to this problem.
