# Dogs-Vs-Cats-Pytorch-Solution
I built a convolutional neural network at the beginning of the semester from scratch using Pytorch. I tried to keep the code as simple as possible. The most interesting part of this solution is to flatten the convolutional network. I found a trick from a youtube comment section which perfectly worked for me!
