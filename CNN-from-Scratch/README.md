# About
I prepared this notebook for the purpose of practicing Pytorch at the beginning of the course. I tried to keep the code simple as my idea was to do everything from scratch. My key learning while working on the solution is to understand how to flatten the convolutional layer. I found the mathematical trick from a youtube channel (Sentdex) which perfectly worked for me!
