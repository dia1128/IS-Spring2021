# About

Human Protein Atalas (HPA) is a Swedish based program. Identifying subcellular protein localization from microscopic images can be easy for expert eyes but difficult to automate. Based on cell images, HPA held a competition to inspire deep learning-based solutions for this task. The goal of this competition is to segment and label each cell in a multiclass image from a large collection of images provided by human protein atlas database. This is an ongoing competition. The code for this project was forked from Kaggle.
