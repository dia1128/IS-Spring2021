# About
## For this work, I used Captum Library that helps to attribute algorithms to interpret:

* Output predictions with respect to inputs
* Output predictions with respect to layers
* Neurons with respect to inputs

## Algorithms:
* DeepLift
* Integrated Gradient
* Saliency Map
* Deep Shap
* Gradient Shap
* Smoothgrad Square
* Layer Integrated Gradient
* Neuron DeepLift
